//Various Test Cases:

  // //LED Test, just to make sure the LED isn't dead
  // digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn on LED
  // Serial.println("LED turned on!");

  // //Pressure Sensor Tester, just making sure it can measure pressure precisely [can probably match to the current Charlottesville weather report]
  // //Pressure Sensor Range Tester, make sure the sensor can read 0-25 PSI properly
  // float currentPressure = mpr.readPressure();
  // Serial.print(currentPressure);

  // //Pressure Sensor Time Tester, change the pressure instantly and see how quickly the readings change based on time stamp
  // float currentPressure = mpr.readPressure();
  // unsigned long currentTime = millis();
  // Serial.print(currentPressure);
  // Serial.print(" PSI at ");
  // Serial.print(currentTime);
  // Serial.println(" ms");
